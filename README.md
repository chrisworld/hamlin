Hamlin
======

Hamlin is a music learning game inspired by the legend of the Pied Piper of Hamlin. We continue the legend many years later - but from a rat’s perspective! Since the Piper’s arrest, music has been banned for its dangerous magical powers and now silence reigns throughout the land of Espero - or so it is believed. But a few brave believers in the power of music have been guarding its secrets, waiting for a hero with enough musical talent to bring melody and joy back to the people of Espero...

Current Project Aim
===================
* Have a improved prototype ready to present for GameDevDays end Aug


Urgent TODO
============
* Expand monk level, split story between monks and have more backstory (did you hear the bridge collapsed?)
* Use library properly, if you finish the level / play the right music bridge magically repaired
* Break up story! People skip through the story
* Cross the bridge to enter rock level, add chords (and rhythm?), more story, create rock level
* Test combat thoroughly to check all bugs have been fixed
* Fix monster rotation - if you escape combat then go back the monster over-rotates
* Player cannot walk through middle of road at a certain point - what is causing this collision? Nothing visible in editor
* Mischa's music teacher is going to send us some more music theory content - short stuff in story and then full content in library book
* Fix keyboard layout for localisation (spanish, english keyboards etc). Find out which keyboard user has and adapt accordingly, let them change controls if they want.
* Fix animation scaling

Ideas
======
* Change UI? make it match with low poly graphics. and minimap!!!! HUD rework
* Background music and scales don't match up - maybe background music changes if you're getting the scale right? OR the monsters play different kinds of music which give you a hint which scale you're meant to play - train your ear instead of just reading the scale
* Make it clearer what the player should do at the start - arrow over monk's head? Rat thought bubble? Game prompt? People don't know what to do
* Everyone likes the sound doppler effect! On/off option?
* Make controls clearer? Should be able to view controls image in-game
* 3rd person camera still needs tweaking - compare to how camera moves with the witcher, mouse needs dragging too much. LEGO game at exhibit had fixed camera
* Mouse feels too necessary - lock mouse completely? keyboard + mouse + MIDI keyboard is too much
* Annnoying that you can see the mouse cursor - hide it
* Need subtitles for intro
* Make it more obvious that people need to press x to continue, bear in mind that they will probs have skipped the dialogue
* More things to interact with!!!!
* Keyboard stickers?? w note names
* Rhythm training mini-games? e.g. at waterfall fish coming past on screen
* First tutorial level abstract or blank - e.g. inside cave? Hamlin wakes up and starts remembering music. Or should cave be for end boss? 
* Music framework so people can import music into the game? Dealing w copyright issues
