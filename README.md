#Hamlin

Hamlin is a music learning game inspired by the legend of the Pied Piper of Hamlin. We continue the legend many years later - but from a rat’s perspective! Since the Piper’s arrest, music has been banned for its dangerous magical powers and now silence reigns throughout the land of Espero - or so it is believed. But a few brave believers in the power of music have been guarding its secrets, waiting for a hero with enough musical talent to bring melody and joy back to the people of Espero...
