Hamlin
======

Hamlin is a music learning game inspired by the legend of the Pied Piper of Hamlin. We continue the legend many years later - but from a rat’s perspective! Since the Piper’s arrest, music has been banned for its dangerous magical powers and now silence reigns throughout the land of Espero - or so it is believed. But a few brave believers in the power of music have been guarding its secrets, waiting for a hero with enough musical talent to bring melody and joy back to the people of Espero...

Current Project Aim
===================
*Have a improved prototype ready to present for GameDevDays end Aug


Urgent TODO
============
*Expand monk level, split story between monks and have more backstory (did you hear the bridge collapsed?)
*Use library properly, if you finish the level / play the right music bridge magically repaired
*BREAK UP STORY!!!!!! people skip through the story
*Cross the bridge to enter rock level (OPEN WORLD!!!), add chords (and rhythm?), more story, create rock level
*FIX COMBAT BUGZZZZZZ!!!
*Mischa's music teacher is going to send us some more music theory content - short stuff in story and then full content in library book
*Bug: signs (sharps/flats) not hidden with monsters - only notes
*Fix keyboard layout for localisation (spanish, english keyboards etc)!!!! find out which keyboard user has and adapt accordingly, let them change controls if they want!!

Ideas
======
*Change UI? make it match with low poly graphics. and minimap!!!! HUD rework
*Background music and scales don't match up - maybe background music changes if you're getting the scale right? OR the monsters play different kinds of music which give you a hint which scale you're meant to play - train your ear instead of just reading the scale
*Make it clearer what the player should do at the start - arrow over monk's head? rat thought bubble? game prompt? people don't know what to do
*Everyone likes the sound doppler effect lol. on/off option?
*Make controls clearer? should be able to view controls image in-game
*3rd person camera still needs tweaking - compare to how camera moves with the witcher, mouse needs dragging too much. LEGO game at exhibit had fixed camera
*Mouse feels too necessary - lock mouse completely? keyboard + mouse + MIDI keyboard is too much
*Annnoying that you can see the mouse cursor - hide it
*Need subtitles for intro
*Make it more obvious that people need to press x to continue, bear in mind that they will probs have skipped the dialogue
*More things to interact with!!!!
*Keyboard stickers?? w note names
*Rhythm training mini-games? e.g. at waterfall fish coming past on screen
