  /* *****THEORY TO TURN INTO DIALOGUE******
  To play scales you only need to know the intervals between the notes and where to start with.
  We have full tones(1 or F) and half tones(1 / 2 or H).
  So for a major scale the sequence of intervals is F, F, H, F, F, F, H, so as if you start with a C and go along all white keys
  you will notice that between E and F there is no black key! This is a half tone! For minor scale it is similar: The sequence is 
  F,H,F,F,H,F,F so as if you start with A and follow all white keys upwards.This rules last for every base key, but there will 
  not only white keys.The circle of fifths shows you for which base - key there are which # or b which mean a half note higher or lower that ne written note.


  WHOLE TONE not full tone hence WT
  the scales in the picture are the CHURCH SCALES which is why we are teaching them at the monastery, mention this

 full tone jumps over a key. eg two white keys next to each other is half tone unless black key inbetween then you skipped a key so it's full tone = two half tones.
 major scale is full tone full tone half tone ...
 so you can work out any scale from the start key just by remembering the sequence of full and half tones you need
 black keys = sharps and flats, check?
 explain controls - row above is black keys on keyboard:
 bottom row y/z x c etc is white keys starting at lower c
 then row above that is black keys for that octave
 then row above that is white keys for upper ocatve
 row above that (numbers) is black keys for upper octave
 other types of scales are different patterns of full and half tones, you can work out in any base key if you know this pattern e.g. c dorian just dorian pattern starting at c key.
